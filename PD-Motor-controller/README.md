Did you know? that most servos used in Robots or RC cars and airplanes are just clever software-controlled DC motors. They do this by attaching an Encoder device to the motor. As the motor rotates the Encoder will send out pulses of voltage and depending on the number of pulses and time between two pulses we can figure out what position the motor is at and its RPM. In this project, all of this is controlled by an Attiny85 microcontroller
